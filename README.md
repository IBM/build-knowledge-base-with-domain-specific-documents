# Build-knowledge-base-with-domain-specific-documents
> Data Science Experience is now Watson Studio. Although some images in this code pattern may show the service as Data Science Experience, the steps and processes will still work.

The Composite code pattern has been designed to give a detailed description to developers who are keen on building the domain specific Knowledge graph. The Code Pattern covers and addresses all the aspects to it, right from the challenges that one can come across while building the knowledge graph and how to resolve them,  how to fine tuning this code pattern to meet their requirements. This Code pattern makes use of the [Watson NLU](https://natural-language-understanding-demo.ng.bluemix.net/), 
[Extend Watson text Classification](https://developer.ibm.com/code/patterns/extend-watson-text-classification/) Code Pattern to augment the entities picked by nlu, and [Watson Document Corelation](https://developer.ibm.com/code/patterns/watson-document-correlation/) from different sources to augment the relations picked by nlu. Basically, it makes the best of both the worlds- rule based and dynamic Watson NLU. Then the results are filtered to meet the needs of that domain.

In this journey we will demonstrate:
* Extracting the information from the documents- free-floating text and Table text.
* Cleaning the data.
* Finding the entities and augment the results using extend watson classification.	
* How to find the relationships between the entities and augment the results by correferencing and correlation using Watson Document Correlation.
* Build a knowledge base(graph) from it.

What make the Code Pattern valuable is its ability to process the tables in docx files along free-floating text and then showcasing the entire strategy on how to make use of both the results of the real-time analysis by Watson NLU and rules defined by a SME. This Composite Code Pattern is intended to help Developers, Data Scientists to give structure to the unstructured data they own which can shape their analysis significantly such that communicating with data will be much easier for further processing and can yield better Insights.

1. The unstructured text data from the docx files (html tables and free floating text) that need to be analyzed and correlated is extracted from the documents using custom python code.
2. The text is classified using NLU and also tagged using the code pattern - [Extend Watson text classification](https://github.com/IBM/watson-document-classifier)
3. The text is correlated with other text using the code pattern - [Correlate documents](https://github.com/IBM/watson-document-co-relation)  
4. The results are filtered using custom python code.
5. The knowledge graph is constructed.

## 4. Add the data and configuration file

#### Add the data and configuration to the notebook

* From the `My Projects > Default` page, Use `Find and Add Data` (look for the `10/01` icon)
and its `Files` tab.
* Click `browse` and navigate to this repo `build-knowledge-base-with-domain-specific-documents/Data/Archive.zip`
* Click `browse` and navigate to this repo `build-knowledge-base-with-domain-specific-documents//Configuration/config_relations.txt`
* Click `browse` and navigate to this repo `build-knowledge-base-with-domain-specific-documents/Configuration/config_classification.txt`

![](doc/source/images/add_file.png)

> Note:  It is possible to use your own data and configuration files.
If you use a configuration file from your computer, make sure to conform to the JSON structure given in `Configuration/config_classification.txt`.

## 5. Update the notebook with service credentials

#### Add the Watson Natural Language Understanding credentials to the notebook
Select the cell below `2.1 Add your service credentials from IBM Cloud for the Watson services` section in the notebook to update the credentials for Watson Natural Language Understanding. 

Open the Watson Natural Language Understanding service in your [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/services) and click on your service, which you should have named `wdc-NLU-service`.

Once the service is open click the `Service Credentials` menu on the left.

![](doc/source/images/service_credentials.png)

In the `Service Credentials` that opens up in the UI, select whichever `Credentials` you would like to use in the notebook from the `KEY NAME` column. Click `View credentials` and copy `username` and `password` key values that appear on the UI in JSON format.

![](doc/source/images/copy_credentials.png)

Update the `username` and `password` key values in the cell below `2.1 Add your service credentials from IBM Cloud for the Watson services` section.

![](doc/source/images/watson_nlu_credentials.png)

#### Add the Object Storage credentials to the notebook
* Select the cell below `2.2 Add your service credentials for Object Storage` section in the notebook to update the credentials for Object Store.
* Delete the contents of the cell

* Use `Find and Add Data` (look for the `10/01` icon) and its `Files` tab. You should see the file names uploaded earlier. Make sure your active cell is the empty one below `2.2 Add...`

* Click `Insert Credentials` from drop down menu.
* Make sure the credentials are saved as `credentials_1`.

![](doc/source/images/objectstorage_credentials.png)

## 6. Run the notebook

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in
the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

> IMPORTANT: The first time you run your notebook, you will need to install the necessary
packages in section 1.1 and then `Restart the kernel`.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag
format is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

* A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
* A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
* A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

* One cell at a time.
  * Select the cell, and then press the `Play` button in the toolbar.
* Batch mode, in sequential order.
  * From the `Cell` menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you
    can `Run All` cells in your notebook, or you can `Run All Below`, that will
    start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then
    continue executing all cells that follow.
* At a scheduled time.
  * Press the `Schedule` button located in the top right section of your notebook
    panel. Here you can schedule your notebook to be executed once at some future
    time, or repeatedly at your specified interval.

## 7. Analyze the results
Check the process section of the notebook. First the configuration files (`config_classification.txt` and `config_relations.txt`) are loaded. The unstructured information is extracted using python package mammoth. Mammoth converts the docx files to html from where text in the tables is also analysed along with free floating text. The results from NLU are analyzed and augmented using the configuration files. The entities are augmented using the `config_classification.txt` and the relationships are augmented using `config_relations.txt`. The results are then filtered and formatted to pick up the relevant relations and discard the ones which are not relevant. The filtered relaionships are sent to draw graph function in the notebook, which will construct the knowledge graph.
